a) Most time is spent on lines 43 and 44 according to kernprof and I would therefore optimize here. Most lines take up pretty much the same amount of memory (at least for N=50)

b) factorize(n,primes) takes most time, and I would try to optimize this. Most lines take up approxmiately equal memory. Memory used in factorize(n,primes) and fast_phi(n,primes) took slighty more memory than gen_primes(n).

c) With N=250 I got:
New version took: 1.761007
Old version took: 2.263931
